The game works as a quiz where the questions are about monuments and world buildings, which are projected in augmented reality through the vofuria framework, where 3d models of these monuments are projected in augmented reality on the flags of their respective countries. The project aimed to generate a greater visual absorption of the world locations and their countries by elementary school students.
